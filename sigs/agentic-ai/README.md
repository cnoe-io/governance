### Vision

Empower each member of the CNOE community with a personalized, multi-agent system (MAS) to meet their unique enterprise needs.

### Mission

We enhance platform engineering and SRE teams by using agentic AI to streamline operations, reduce bottlenecks, and ease the challenges of managing cloud-native infrastructure, while leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to offer application developers an intuitive self-service experience that boosts productivity and fosters creativity.
