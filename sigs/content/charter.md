# SIG Content

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Kubernetes Community Governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) and uses
the Roles and Organization Management outlined in [sig-governance](../../SIG-Governance.md).

# Scope

SIG Content is responsible for maintaining CNOE content, including content on our web properties (primarily cnoe.io). 

## Out of scope

Content within the code repositories of our tools, such as in-repository documentation of idpbuilder and stacks \(which are governed by [SIG IDP-Builders](../idp-builders/charter.md)\) is out of scope. However, content on the cnoe.io website which references these tools *is* in the scope of this SIG.
