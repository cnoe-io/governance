# SIG Governance

CNOE Special Interest Groups (SIGs) generally align with the scope, purpose, and and governance processes defined by [Kubernetes SIG Governance](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/committee-steering/governance/sig-governance.md). Although there are many cases where we cannot replicate the specifics of this Kubernetes process, we aim to align ourselves with the spirit of this process.

## Roles

As we are a smaller community than Kubernetes, we have simplified the Roles for SIG and their subprojects. We also are folding in [community roles](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md) to SIGs and their subprojects.


| Role | Responsibilities | Requirements | Defined by |
| -----| ---------------- | ------------ | -------|
| Reviewer | Review contributions from other members | History of review and authorship in a subproject | [OWNERS] file reviewer entry |
| Approver | Contributions acceptance approval| Highly experienced active reviewer and contributor to a subproject | [OWNERS] file approver entry|
| Subproject owner | Set direction and priorities for a subproject | Demonstrated responsibility and excellent technical judgement for the subproject | [sigs.yaml] subproject [OWNERS] file *owners* entry |
| Lead | Set direction and priorities for a SIG | Demonstrated responsibility and excellent technical judgement for the SIG | sig [OWNERS] file *owners* entry |
