# CNOE Governance

This document outlines the formal decision making processes which run the CNOE project.

## Principles

- Open: See CONTRIBUTING.md
- Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
- Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. See SIG governance, below.
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.


## Membership

CNOE is governed by a set of "core" member organizations. These member organizations each nominate a representative to the steering committee which is the final decision making body for CNOE. Member additions can be made by unanimous approval by the steering committee. Member removals can be made by (unanimous - 1) approval by the steering commitee.

Core Member Organizations:
- Adobe
- Amazon
- Autodesk
- Salesforce
- Twilio
- Intuit

## Steering Committee

The steering committee consists of one member from each of the core member organizations. Decisions are made by majority vote of the overall committee membership unless stated otherwise, such as is the case for membership changes.

### Charter

1. Define the mission and vision of the CNOE project.
2. Manage core membership.
3. Define and evolve CNOE governance.
4. Manage and delegate ownership of access to CNOE resources.
5. Handle reports of Code of Conduct violations in a confidential manner.
6. Act as the final escalation point for any disputes or decisions within the CNOE project.

## Working Groups

Over time we will formalize our working group proceses, pulling from standard OSS processes such at Kubernetes' SIGs. In the meanwhile, the steering committee is responsible for managing the working groups CNOE consists of.

## Contact

Issues, CoC violations, and interest can be directed to the steering commitee by emailing cnoe-steering@googlegroups.com.

## Code of Conduct

See [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
