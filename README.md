# CNOE Governance

This document outlines the formal decision making processes which run the CNOE project.

## Principles

- Open: See CONTRIBUTING.md
- Welcoming and respectful: See Code of Conduct, below.
- Transparent and accessible: Work and collaboration should be done in public. See SIG governance, below.
- Merit: Ideas and contributions are accepted according to their technical merit and alignment with project objectives, scope, and design principles.


## Membership

CNOE is governed by a set of "core" member organizations. These member organizations each nominate a representative to the steering committee which is the final decision making body for CNOE. Member additions can be made by unanimous approval by the steering committee. Member removals can be made by (unanimous - 1) approval by the steering commitee.

Core Member Organizations:
- Adobe
- Amazon
- Autodesk
- Nike
- Salesforce
- Twilio
- Intuit
- Cisco

## Steering Committee

The steering committee consists of one member from each of the core member organizations. Decisions are made by majority vote of the overall committee membership unless stated otherwise, such as is the case for membership changes.
